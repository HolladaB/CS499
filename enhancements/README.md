## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement
[Original code](https://github.com/HolladaB/CS499/blob/f706d20e83d0c8b55035e539324da4567f04b534/originals/CS340/Original2.zip)
[Enhanced code](https://github.com/HolladaB/CS499/blob/73023debf4ab2112c372a3e8f22947a27a1d8990/enhancements/Artifact1.zip)

To run this, the program was desinged to run through andriod studio. The testing was done on a medium phone API 35, but should run on different sizes as that is the intention of the design.
