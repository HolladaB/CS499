# Artifact Enhancments
## Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

To run this, the program was desinged to run through andriod studio. The testing was done on a medium phone API 35, but should run on different sizes as that is the intention of the design. 

## Algorithms and Data Structure Enhancement

This program can be run through visual studio code. This version of the design does not require the database to be setup. 

## Databases Enhancement

This program can be run through visual studio code. This version of the design requires a database to be setup to function correctly. I utilized mySQL to create and authorize the database. Below is a pdf that has pictures showing these steps at the end of the document
